# Hidden
# ------
# In GNOME environments, indicates to the desktop environment whether the
# application should be displayed in the autostart settings UI. If
# hidden, autostart is also disabled. The user  can enable or disable
# autostart only if it is not hidden.
#
# In non-GNOME environments, `Hidden` means "disable". It indicates to the
# desktop environment the default autostart enabling status when the
# application is installed. It doesn't hide the application in the autostart
# settings UI.
# - `Hidden=false` means that the desktop environment will enable autostart as
#    soon as the application is installed.
# - `Hidden=true` means that the desktop environment will show the autostart
#   feature as available to the user, but not enabled.
# In both cases the user can enable or disable autostart as desired.

      - |-
        Fixed some high-profile bugs, especially activity monitoring problems
        when running X.

        A bug was introduced in version 1.6.0 which could cause the status
        window to disappear. Version 1.6.1 is only a minor bug fix release that
        addresses this problem.

        Workrave has been translated into Chinese thanks to Rex Tsai, into
        Russian thanks to Sergey Kirkinsky, and into French thanks to Thomas
        Basset and Benjamin Siband.
      - |-
        The explanation of an exercise is now scrollable, if it does not fit
        onscreen.
      - |-
        The Windows version now includes a taskbar applet version of the status
        window. After installation of Workrave, right click your taskbar and
        select "Workrave" from the list of toolbars.
      - |-
        Timers can be configured to ignore activity.
      - |-
        Bloat removal: removed the "Resets at" option from the daily limit panel.
      - |-
        Exercises are no longer read at program startup, and are released from
        memory when not needed anymore.
      - |-
        Terminology: we now use the term "micro-break" instead of "micro-pause".
      - |-
        When block mode "Block all" is used, we display the break window on top
        of your current desktop background (wallpaper), instead of on a
        semi-transparent screen snapshot.
      - |-
        Fixed screen locking on X11: previously only xlock was detected and used
        without passing a display parameter. Now, the proper screen lock command
        is invoked on the right display. For example, if KDE is detected its
        kdesktop_lock is executed.
      - |-
        High-profile bug fixes (Windows): activity monitoring when working in
        Exceed has been restored, and ZoneLab interaction problems (hangups)
        have been corrected.

  - version: 1.4.1
    date: 2003-11-03T20:32:00+00:00
    changes:
      - |-
        Replaced the "Block input" setting (which was available per break) by a
        global "Block mode" setting, located in the GUI preferences. The
        available block modes are "None" (NEW: no input is blocked and break
        windows have a title bar and can be dragged), "Block input" (blocks
        input, break windows are fixed), "Block all" (NEW: blocks input and
        display).
      - |-
        The Windows installer now offers the option to install Workrave using
        the standalone Dropline GTK+ runtime. For more information, see
        http://www.dropline.net/gtk/.
      - |-
        Removed the "Force break after maximum preludes" option. It is now on by
        default.
      - |-
        Some strings in the German translation were too long, fixed.
      - |-
        Added multihead support for Windows.
      - |-
        Improved suspend (to ram) support. Workrave now assumes that you are
        idle while suspended instead of assuming that no time passes.
      - |-
        Improved multihead support. The status window is now automatically
        relocated when the monitor on which it is displayed is removed. It moved
        back to its original location when the monitor returns.
      - |-
        Exercises navigation can now be used without causing Workrave to remove
        the break window and show the warning windows again.
      - |-
        If supported by your system, the daily limit window includes a "Shut
        down" button.
      - |-
        There now is a "Lock" button on the rest break, so that you can safely
        lock your display while you are taking breaks. If the daily limit window
        does not include the "Shut down" button, it includes the "Lock" button
        instead.

    changes:
      - |-
        Added exercises.
      - |-
        Workrave has been translated to Polish, Danish and Spanish. Many thanks
        to Mikolaj Machowski, Christian Vejlbo, and Pablo Rodriguez!
      - |
        Multihead support for X11. Workrave now shows break windows on all
        monitors.
      - |-
        Workrave can now cope with changes in system time and OS features like
        suspend-to-ram.
      - |-
        Previously, the end time that showed up in the stats dialog equaled the
        time at which the clock reset (typically equal to the start of the next
        working day). This lead to weird from/to times, as in: "From 8:46 to
        9:10". Fixed.
      - |-
        Added an icon to the skip/postpone buttons on break windows.
      - |-
        Many laptop pointer devices "drift" over time. This used to cause
        Workrave to detect activity when there was in fact none. Fixed, thanks
        to Chung-chieh Shan.
      - |-
        On Windows, Workrave now notices when Explorer crashes and will try to
        reinsert the tray icon in the new Explorer taskbar that is created when
        Explorer restarts.
      - |-
        Rewrote the user input blocking mechanism on Windows. You should no
        longer experience visual quirks (like flashing windows or unexpectedly
        focusing random windows) during breaks.
      - |-
        On Linux, Workrave now notices when the gnome-panel crashes and will
        reinsert the applet in the new panel.
      - |-
        The content of the status window can now be configured.
      - |-
        Breaks can now be disabled.

  - version: 1.2.2
    date: 2003-03-25T19:24:54+00:00
    changes:
      - |-
        If you stopped working during a prelude just before it was about to
        disappear, the prelude would still go away because Workrave assumed you
        wanted to continue working. This behaviour has been changed now: if
        there is no activity when the count-down has reached zero, Workrave
        waits a couple of seconds to see if you are really idle. If that is the
        case, a break window appears. If not, you can continue working.
      - |-
        Redesigned the preferences panel. It used to have nested tabs, these
        have been replaced with an icon shortcut bar.
      - |-
        The break windows have been given a title.
      - |-
        The Window version now included GTK-Wimp. This makes the visual
        appearance of Workrave blend much better into the Windows desktop
        environment (http://gtk-wimp.sourceforge.net).
      - |-
        Beter support for Gnome session management. Workrave is now properly
        restarted by the gnome session manager.
      - |-
        The applet can now be configured to show only the Workrave sheep.
        Clicking on the sheep will toggle the visibility of the main window.

  - version: 1.2.1

    changes:
      - |-
        Some errors in the build process have been fixed. Only a new source
        tarball is released, as this does not effect binary releases.

      - |-
        Johannes Rohr provided a german translation, thanks!
      - |-
        Added applet support. Workrave now supports both a native Gnome applet,
        as well as a system tray applet that *should* also work on KDE.
      - |-
        Added statistics. Workrave shows break statistics and daily usage. More
        statistics will be added later.
      - |-
        A leaflet promoting Workrave is now available. Please spread it as far
        as possible. For example, distribute several copies at the office.
        (http://workrave.sourceforge.net/leaflet/)
      - |-
        Last but absolutely not least: increased sheep size in the about window. :)

  - version: 1.0.0
    date: 2002-10-30T19:37:59+00:00
    changes:
      - |-
        Removed the monitoring preferences. Good defaults is all you want here,
        and it was far too difficult to try and explain these settings to
        ordinary users.
      - |-
        Added the daily limit break window.
      - |-
        Added internationalisation support. Currently, only a Dutch translation
        is provided. We are still looking for volunteers to translate Workrave
        into other languages.
      - |-
        The "Collective" has been renamed to "Network", which is far more
        meaningful to non-geek users.
      - |-
        A network log window has been added. This window shows informational
        messages about the communication between different Workrave instances.

  - version: 0.3.0
    date: 2002-10-11T20:51:08+00:00
    changes:
      - |-
        Added experimental(!) distribution support, dubbed "The Collective".
        What this means is that you can now create a network of Workrave
        instances running on several computers. All instances that are part of
        "the collective" share the same timer information, meaning that if one
        computer informs you to take a break, it is futile to flee to another
        computer as it will also tell you to take a break.

      - |-
        Added sound support. You can configure the samples that are played
        through the standard sound control panel provided by Gnome and Windows.
        For office PCs that do not have a sound card, you can choose to play
        sounds through the internal PC speaker.

      - |-
        The window prompting you to brake now moves earlier to the top of the
        screen so that it does not interfere too much. Furthermore, the window
        has a new and improved "evasive maneuvers" algorithm.

  - version: 0.2.0
    date: 2002-09-26T17:44:37+00:00
    changes:
      - |-
        Activity during a persisted break is no longer ignored. Instead, the
        timer is stopped whenefer the user is active.
      - |-
        Microsoft Windows specific changes
        - Added taskbar tray support. When the main window is closed, the
          program remains active in the tray. In the user interface preferences,
          you can select to hide the program when started.
        - The main window is now opened at the position where it was during the
          last program exit.

  - version: 0.1.0
    date: 2002-09-22T20:49:02+00:00
    changes:
      - First public release.

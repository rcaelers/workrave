# Workrave 1.10

Please visit https://workrave.org for more information.

## Install

- Windows: download from https://workrave.org/download
- Ubuntu: install with the "Ubuntu Software" application. (Note: not working with wayland on Ubuntu 17.10)
- Ubuntu (and derivatives) Linux latest version:  
  Add this PPA to your Software Sources  
  `ppa:rob-caelers/workrave`  
  either in the Ubuntu Software application, or from the terminal:
  ```
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rob-caelers/workrave  
  sudo apt-get update
  ```
- Arch Linux users: use `sudo pacman -S workrave` to install from the community repository
- Ubuntu and Debian users: `sudo apt-get install workrave`
- FreeBSD users: `pkg install workrave`

## Troubleshooting

### Show timers applet in Cinnamon
To make timers visible you need to explicitly add Workrave applet to a panel. In the other case only workrave icon is shown.

## Technical Information
Have a look at the [contrib](./contrib) directory to get a little insight into the different scripting possibilities!

### Unix/Linux
- Workrave uses [dconf](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/dconf) to store its configuration. 
  `dconf-editor` can be used to explore and manipulate the values - be careful!
- Workrave can receive [dbus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) signals.
  Explore by having a look at the [example python script](./backend/src/dbus-example.py) or viewing in `qdbusviewer` (part of the `qttools5-dev-tools` package in Ubuntu).

In both of these, workrave is found under the `org.workrave` key.

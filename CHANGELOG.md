Sat Feb 15 22:03:40 2014 

    Improved support for locking the screen
    
    It now works on most desktop environments, prefers D-Bus instead
    of executing raw commands and the code is much better organized.
    
    The code now supports two general methods of suspending: via DBus
    (implemented in ScreenLockDBus.??) and via CommandLine
    (implemented in ScreenLockCommandline.??).
    Both classes inherit from a single interface: IScreenLockMethod.
    
    
    The code was tested on Unity, Gnome3, KDE, Xfce, LXDE and i3 as of
    Ubuntu 12.04.

Fri Feb 14 15:29:04 2014

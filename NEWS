* Workrave 1.6.2

** Added a Brazilian Portuguese translation, thanks to Claudio
Ferreira Filho!

** Workrave now respects the "gtk-button-images" property.

** Upgraded GTK runtime to version 2.4, fixing some minor UI quirks.

** Fixed some high-profile bugs, especially activity monitoring
problems when running X.


* Workrave 1.6.1

** A bug was introduced in version 1.6.0 which could cause the status
window to disappear. Version 1.6.1 is only a minor bug fix release
that addresses this problem.


* Workrave 1.6.0

** Workrave has been translated into Chinese thanks to Rex Tsai, into
Russian thanks to Sergey Kirkinsky, and into French thanks to Thomas Basset
and Benjamin Siband.

** The explanation of an exercise is now scrollable, if it does not
fit onscreen.

** The Windows version now includes a taskbar applet version of the
status window. After installation of Workrave, right click your
taskbar and select "Workrave" from the list of toolbars.

** Timers can be configured to ignore activity.

** Bloat removal: removed the "Resets at" option from the daily limit
panel.

** Exercises are no longer read at program startup, and are released
from memory when not needed anymore.

** Terminology: we now use the term "micro-break" instead of "micro-pause".

** When block mode "Block all" is used, we display the break window on
top of your current desktop background (wallpaper), instead of on a
semi-transparent screen snapshot. 

** Fixed screen locking on X11: previously only xlock was detected and
used without passing a display parameter. Now, the proper screen
lock command is invoked on the right display. For example, if KDE is
detected its kdesktop_lock is executed.

** High-profile bug fixes (Windows): activity monitoring when working
in Exceed has been restored, and ZoneLab interaction problems
(hangups) have been corrected.


* Workrave 1.4.1

** Replaced the "Block input" setting (which was available per break)
by a global "Block mode" setting, located in the GUI preferences. The
available block modes are "None" (NEW: no input is blocked and break
windows have a title bar and can be dragged), "Block input" (blocks
input, break windows are fixed), "Block all" (NEW: blocks input and
display).

** The Windows installer now offers the option to install Workrave
using the standalone Dropline GTK+ runtime. For more information, see
http://www.dropline.net/gtk/.

** Removed the "Force break after maximum preludes" option. It is now
on by default.

** Some strings in the German translation were too long, fixed.

** Added multihead support for Windows.

** Improved suspend (to ram) support. Workrave now assumes that you
are idle while suspended instead of assuming that no time passes.

** Improved multihead support. The status window is now automatically
relocated when the monitor on which it is displayed is removed. It
moved back to its original location when the monitor returns.

** Exercises navigation can now be used without causing Workrave to
remove the break window and show the warning windows again.

** If supported by your system, the daily limit window includes a
"Shut down" button.

** There now is a "Lock" button on the rest break, so that you can
safely lock your display while you are taking breaks. If the daily
limit window does not include the "Shut down" button, it includes the
"Lock" button instead.


* Workrave 1.4.0

** Added exercises.

** Workrave has been translated to Polish, Danish and Spanish. Many
thanks to Mikolaj Machowski, Christian Vejlbo, and Pablo Rodriguez!

** Multihead support for X11. Workrave now shows break windows on
all monitors.

** Workrave can now cope with changes in system time and OS features
like suspend-to-ram.

** Previously, the end time that showed up in the stats dialog equaled
the time at which the clock reset (typically equal to the start of the
next working day).  This lead to weird from/to times, as in: "From
8:46 to 9:10". Fixed.

** Added an icon to the skip/postpone buttons on break windows.

** Many laptop pointer devices "drift" over time. This used to cause
Workrave to detect activity when there was in fact none.  Fixed,
thanks to Chung-chieh Shan.

** On Windows, Workrave now notices when Explorer crashes and will try
to reinsert the tray icon in the new Explorer taskbar that is created
when Explorer restarts.

** Rewrote the user input blocking mechanism on Windows. You should no
longer experience visual quirks (like flashing windows or unexpectedly
focusing random windows) during breaks.

** On Linux, Workrave now notices when the gnome-panel crashes and
will reinsert the applet in the new panel.

** The content of the status window can now be configured.

** Breaks can now be disabled.


* Workrave 1.2.2

** If you stopped working during a prelude just before it was about to
disappear, the prelude would still go away because Workrave assumed
you wanted to continue working. This behaviour has been changed now:
if there is no activity when the count-down has reached zero, Workrave
waits a couple of seconds to see if you are really idle. If that is
the case, a break window appears. If not, you can continue working.

** Redesigned the preferences panel. It used to have nested tabs,
these have been replaced with an icon shortcut bar.

** The break windows have been given a title.

** The Window version now included GTK-Wimp. This makes the visual
appearance of Workrave blend much better into the Windows desktop
environment (http://gtk-wimp.sourceforge.net).

** Beter support for Gnome session management. Workrave is now
properly restarted by the gnome session manager.

** The applet can now be configured to show only the Workrave sheep.
Clicking on the sheep will toggle the visibility of the main window.


* Workrave 1.2.1

** Some errors in the build process have been fixed. Only a new source
tarball is released, as this does not effect binary releases.


* Workrave 1.2.0

** Johannes Rohr provided a german translation, thanks!

** Added applet support. Workrave now supports both a native Gnome
applet, as well as a system tray applet that *should* also work on
KDE.

** Added statistics. Workrave shows break statistics and daily usage.
More statistics will be added later.

** A leaflet promoting Workrave is now available.  Please spread it as
far as possible.  For example, distribute several copies at the
office.  (http://workrave.sourceforge.net/leaflet/)

** Last but absolutely not least: increased sheep size in the about
window. :)


* Workrave 1.0.0

** Removed the monitoring preferences. Good defaults is all you want
here, and it was far too difficult to try and explain these settings
to ordinary users.

** Added the daily limit break window.

** Added internationalisation support. Currently, only a Dutch translation is
provided. We are still looking for volunteers to translate Workrave
into other languages.

** The "Collective" has been renamed to "Network", which is far more
meaningful to non-geek users.

** A network log window has been added. This window shows informational
messages about the communication between different Workrave instances. 


* Workrave 0.3.0

** Added experimental(!) distribution support, dubbed "The
Collective". What this means is that you can now create a network of
Workrave instances running on several computers. All instances that
are part of "the collective" share the same timer information, meaning
that if one computer informs you to take a break, it is futile to flee
to another computer as it will also tell you to take a break.

** Added sound support. You can configure the samples that are played
through the standard sound control panel provided by Gnome and
Windows. For office PCs that do not have a sound card, you can choose
to play sounds through the internal PC speaker.

** The window prompting you to brake now moves earlier to the top of
the screen so that it does not interfere too much. Furthermore, the
window has a new and improved "evasive manouvers" algorithm.


* Workrave 0.2.0

** Activity during a persisted break is no longer ignored. Instead,
the timer is stopped whenefer the user is active.

** Microsoft Windows specific changes

*** Added taskbar tray support. When the main window is closed, the
program remains active in the tray. In the user interface preferences,
you can select to hide the program when started.

*** The main window is now opened at the position where it was during
the last program exit.

* Workrave 0.1.0

** First public release.

   screen snapshot.
** Fixed screen locking on X11: previously only xlock was detected and used
   without passing a display parameter. Now, the proper screen lock command is
   invoked on the right display. For example, if KDE is detected its
   kdesktop_lock is executed.
** High-profile bug fixes (Windows): activity monitoring when working in Exceed
   has been restored, and ZoneLab interaction problems (hangups) have been
   corrected.

* Workrave 1.4.1

** Replaced the "Block input" setting (which was available per break) by a global
   "Block mode" setting, located in the GUI preferences. The available block
   modes are "None" (NEW: no input is blocked and break windows have a title bar
   and can be dragged), "Block input" (blocks input, break windows are fixed),
   "Block all" (NEW: blocks input and display).
** The Windows installer now offers the option to install Workrave using the
   standalone Dropline GTK+ runtime. For more information, see
   http://www.dropline.net/gtk/.
** Removed the "Force break after maximum preludes" option. It is now on by
   default.
** Some strings in the German translation were too long, fixed.
** Added multihead support for Windows.
** Improved suspend (to ram) support. Workrave now assumes that you are idle
   while suspended instead of assuming that no time passes.
** Improved multihead support. The status window is now automatically relocated
   when the monitor on which it is displayed is removed. It moved back to its
   original location when the monitor returns.
** Exercises navigation can now be used without causing Workrave to remove the
   break window and show the warning windows again.
** If supported by your system, the daily limit window includes a "Shut down"
   button.
** There now is a "Lock" button on the rest break, so that you can safely lock
   your display while you are taking breaks. If the daily limit window does not
   include the "Shut down" button, it includes the "Lock" button instead.

* Workrave 1.4.0

** Added exercises.
** Workrave has been translated to Polish, Danish and Spanish. Many thanks to
   Mikolaj Machowski, Christian Vejlbo, and Pablo Rodriguez!
** Multihead support for X11. Workrave now shows break windows on all monitors.
** Workrave can now cope with changes in system time and OS features like
   suspend-to-ram.
** Previously, the end time that showed up in the stats dialog equaled the time
   at which the clock reset (typically equal to the start of the next working
   day). This lead to weird from/to times, as in: "From 8:46 to 9:10". Fixed.
** Added an icon to the skip/postpone buttons on break windows.
** Many laptop pointer devices "drift" over time. This used to cause Workrave to
   detect activity when there was in fact none. Fixed, thanks to Chung-chieh
   Shan.
** On Windows, Workrave now notices when Explorer crashes and will try to
   reinsert the tray icon in the new Explorer taskbar that is created when
   Explorer restarts.
** Rewrote the user input blocking mechanism on Windows. You should no longer
   experience visual quirks (like flashing windows or unexpectedly focusing
   random windows) during breaks.
** On Linux, Workrave now notices when the gnome-panel crashes and will reinsert
   the applet in the new panel.
** The content of the status window can now be configured.
** Breaks can now be disabled.

* Workrave 1.2.2

** If you stopped working during a prelude just before it was about to disappear,
   the prelude would still go away because Workrave assumed you wanted to
   continue working. This behaviour has been changed now: if there is no activity
   when the count-down has reached zero, Workrave waits a couple of seconds to
   see if you are really idle. If that is the case, a break window appears. If
   not, you can continue working.
** Redesigned the preferences panel. It used to have nested tabs, these have been
   replaced with an icon shortcut bar.
** The break windows have been given a title.
** The Window version now included GTK-Wimp. This makes the visual appearance of
   Workrave blend much better into the Windows desktop environment
   (http://gtk-wimp.sourceforge.net).
** Beter support for Gnome session management. Workrave is now properly restarted
   by the gnome session manager.
** The applet can now be configured to show only the Workrave sheep. Clicking on
   the sheep will toggle the visibility of the main window.

* Workrave 1.2.1

** Some errors in the build process have been fixed. Only a new source tarball is
   released, as this does not effect binary releases.

* Workrave 1.2.0

** Johannes Rohr provided a german translation, thanks!
** Added applet support. Workrave now supports both a native Gnome applet, as
   well as a system tray applet that should also work on KDE.
** Added statistics. Workrave shows break statistics and daily usage. More
   statistics will be added later.
** A leaflet promoting Workrave is now available. Please spread it as far as
   possible. For example, distribute several copies at the office.
   (http://workrave.sourceforge.net/leaflet/)
** Last but absolutely not least: increased sheep size in the about window. :)

* Workrave 1.0.0

** Removed the monitoring preferences. Good defaults is all you want here, and it
   was far too difficult to try and explain these settings to ordinary users.
** Added the daily limit break window.
** Added internationalisation support. Currently, only a Dutch translation is
   provided. We are still looking for volunteers to translate Workrave into other
   languages.
** The "Collective" has been renamed to "Network", which is far more meaningful
   to non-geek users.
** A network log window has been added. This window shows informational messages
   about the communication between different Workrave instances.

* Workrave 0.3.0

** Added experimental(!) distribution support, dubbed "The Collective". What this
   means is that you can now create a network of Workrave instances running on
   several computers. All instances that are part of "the collective" share the
   same timer information, meaning that if one computer informs you to take a
   break, it is futile to flee to another computer as it will also tell you to
   take a break.
** Added sound support. You can configure the samples that are played through the
   standard sound control panel provided by Gnome and Windows. For office PCs
   that do not have a sound card, you can choose to play sounds through the
   internal PC speaker.
** The window prompting you to brake now moves earlier to the top of the screen
   so that it does not interfere too much. Furthermore, the window has a new and
   improved "evasive maneuvers" algorithm.

* Workrave 0.2.0

** Activity during a persisted break is no longer ignored. Instead, the timer is
   stopped whenefer the user is active.
** Microsoft Windows specific changes
   - Added taskbar tray support. When the main window is closed, the program
     remains active in the tray. In the user interface preferences, you can
     select to hide the program when started.
   - The main window is now opened at the position where it was during the last
     program exit.

* Workrave 0.1.0

** First public release.

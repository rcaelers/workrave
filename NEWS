* Workrave 0.4.0

** Added internationalisation support. Currently, only a Dutch translation is
provided. We are still looking for volunteers to translate Workrave
into other languages.

** The "Collective" has been renamed to "Network".

** A network log window has been added. This window shows informational
messages about the communication between different Workrave instances. 

* Workrave 0.3.0

** Added experimental(!) distribution support, dubbed "The
Collective". What this means is that you can now create a network of
Workrave instances running on several computers. All instances that
are part of "the collective" share the same timer information, meaning
that if one computer informs you to take a break, it is futile to flee
to another computer as it will also tell you to take a break.

** Added sound support. You can configure the samples that are played
through the standard sound control panel provided by Gnome and
Windows. For office PCs that do not have a sound card, you can choose
to play sounds through the internal PC speaker.

** The window prompting you to brake now moves earlier to the top of
the screen so that it does not interfere too much. Furthermore, the
window has a new and improved "evasive manouvers" algorithm.

* Workrave 0.2.0

** Activity during a persisted break is no longer ignored. Instead,
the timer is stopped whenefer the user is active.

** Microsoft Windows specific changes

*** Added taskbar tray support. When the main window is closed, the
program remains active in the tray. In the user interface preferences,
you can select to hide the program when started.

*** The main window is now opened at the position where it was during
the last program exit.

* Workrave 0.1.0

** First public release.

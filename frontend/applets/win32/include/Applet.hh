/*!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
On Windows x64, the installed Applet will be 64-bit.

Therefore Workrave (32-bit) could be passing structures to a
64-bit applet. And so we must ensure that all members of any
passed structure have types that are the same size on both
32 and 64 bit Windows.

All structures declared in this file are used by both
Workrave (x86) and the applet (x86 & x64).
